## Testimonials

<testimonial user="Atinux" display-name="SÃ©bastien Chopin" display-title="CTO, Nuxt.js">

  I'm not sure Nuxt 3 is relevant anymore, or at least I'd have to make Nuxt Hue a default on it.

  I'm happy that global module are now a thing. I'd definitely have everyone use Nuxt Hue at Passionate People.
