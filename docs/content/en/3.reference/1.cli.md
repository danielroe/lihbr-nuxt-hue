Here's the full reference of commands exposed by the CLI with demo, running the `help` command should already give you enough information about it anyway...

## Very Useful

### help, --help, -h

Display help for `nuxt-hue`, it's documented! Woah!

![help](/assets/img/help.gif)

### setup

Connect to a bridge and select scenes Nuxt Hue needs to trigger, useful after first installation. Really if it's your first time: JUST. RUN. THIS. COMMAND.

### status

Check Nuxt Hue status, should tell you if everything is alright or if you need to do something special~

### enable

Enable Nuxt Hue module in case you turned it off by mistake, or tested the next command...

### disable

Disable Nuxt Hue module, you won't be cool anymore. It's just a test right?

## Useful

### connect

Connect to a new bridge, or connect again to the only one you have in most cases if its IP has changed.

### scenes

Select scenes Nuxt Hue needs to trigger, useful once you've spent some time setting up some dedicated Nuxt-themed scenes.

### version, --version, -v

Display `nuxt-hue` installed version. You can use that to compare it to [the latest version on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-hue) to know if you need to update one of your most useful development tool manually. I've been lazy to implement an automatic check so far...

## Not Useful

### wipe

Like `rm -rf /*` but for Nuxt Hue config, [see dedicated section](/uninstalling) (stay here, it's not interesting, only uncool people go there)

### trigger-scene &lt;SCENEID&gt;

[INTERNAL] Trigger a specific scene, why are you even reading this...
